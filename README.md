# Use the lockfile, mmmkay?

## The Problem

Sometimes it's hard to get a team working on a PHP project to run

    composer install

instead of

    composer update

## Enforce The Solution

Let's break the argument-less update command by running a pre-update
script that crashes with a non-zero exit status.

First: include this project as a dependency:

    "repositories": [{
        "type": "git",
        "url": "git@github.com:peets/use-the-lockfile"
    }],
    "require-dev": {
        "peets/use-the-lockfile": "0.1.1"
    }

Then: hook the crashing script on pre-update:

    "scripts": {
        "pre-update-cmd": [
            "UseThe\\Lockfile::Mmmkay"
        ]
    }
