It appears you're trying to update the project dependencies.

        You're doing it wrong.

What you want to do is run `composer install`.

Not only is it safer (everyone working on the project will have the
same versions of all dependencies), it's also much faster.

Direct all complaints to ppp@salesfloor.net, and have a nice day.
